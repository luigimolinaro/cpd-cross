# All tested cartridges. To install, change the "state" property to "installed". To uninstall, change the state
# to "removed" or comment out the entire cartridge. Make sure that the "-" and properties are aligned with the lite
# cartridge; the "-" is at position 3 and the property starts at position 5.
#
# If a cartridge has dependencies and you want to install it, you must ensure that the dependent cartridge is also
# installed.
